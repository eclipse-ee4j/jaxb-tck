.  The zip file above contains the XML Binding TCK installer jar file;
use this installer to install the XML Binding TCK.
  a.  Extract the {TechnologyShortName} TCK {TechnologyVersion} product bundle
      in the directory of your choice: +
      +`java -jar `<xml_binding_tck_jar>` options [-o outputdir]`+ +
      The following descriptions are provided for the installation command:
    * `java`: Java SE {SEversion} or later platform implementation.
    * `<xml_binding_tck_jar>`: The path of the {TechnologyShortName}
      TCK {TechnologyVersion} JAR file to install.
    * `options`: Unless a user specifies options, the default
      behavior installs {TechnologyShortName} TCK {TechnologyVersion}
      in verbose mode (writes the file names it is installing to
      standard out) into the current directory. The installation
      utility accepts the following options:
      ** `-q`: Installs {TechnologyShortName} {TechnologyVersion} in quiet mode.
	    ** `-l`: Prints a list to standard output of the options that
         will be installed.
	    ** `-onError mode` : Sets the mode of sensitivity that the
	       installer has to errors.  The `–onError` : Instructs
	       what to do when it encounters an error while installing
	       {TechnologyShortName} TCK {TechnologyVersion}.  This
	       option has three valid modes:
	       *** `ignore`: Instructs the installer to ignore any
	           errors and continue installation.
	       *** `report`: Instructs the installer to continue with
	           the installation but report any errors when the
	           installation is completed.
	       *** `fail`: Instructs the installer to stop installation
	           once an error is encountered.
      ** `–usage`: Prints a usage message to standard out and exits (not listed
         as an option in the usage message).
      ** `–help`: Prints a help message to standard out and exits
	       (not listed as an option in the help message).
    * `[-o outputdir]`: Installs {TechnologyShortName} TCK {TechnologyVersion}
      into the directory specified by `outputdir`.
  b.  This action creates the `XMLB-TCK-3.0` directory. The topmost
      {TechnologyShortName} TCK installation directory is referred to
      as the Test Suite Home, or `TS_HOME`.
