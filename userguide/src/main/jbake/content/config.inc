4.1 Configuring the XML Binding TCK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[GCLHUB]][[tck-configuration-concepts]]

4.1.1 TCK Configuration Concepts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
{TechnologyShortName} {TechnologyVersion} comprises of a schema
compiler and a schema generator. Both are types of compilers; the
former maps from a schema to Java, and the latter maps from Java to
schema.  For the purposes of brevity in these instructions, the term
compiler refers to both the schema compiler and the schema generator.

Configuring Your Environment to Run the TCK Against the Compatible Implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Set the following environment variables in your shell environment:
  a.  `JAVA_HOME` to the directory in which Java SE 8 is installed
  b.  `TS_HOME` to the directory in which the {TechnologyShortName} TCK software
  is installed
  c.  `JAXB_HOME` to the directory in which the {TechnologyShortName} software
  is installed
  d.  `PATH` to include the following directories: `$JAVA_HOME/bin`,
  `$JAXWS_HOME/bin`, and `$ANT_HOME/bin`
2.  Edit `$TS_HOME/testsuite.jtt` and modify `finder` settings to contain proper
   {TechnologyShortName} TCK software installation directory path prefix
3.  Choose {TechnologyShortName} TCK software configuration file template to use:
  a.  `$TS_HOME/lib/javasoft-multiJVM.jti` to run tests in multi JVM mode
  (this is the default configuration template)
  b.  or `$TS_HOME/lib/javasoft-singleJVM.jti` to run tests in single JVM mode
4.  Copy choosen file as `$TS_HOME/lib/ts.jti`
5. Edit `$TS_HOME/lib/ts.jti` file and set environment variables
   and configuration properties.
  a.  Set `TESTSUITE` environment variable to contain {TechnologyShortName}
      TCK software installation directory.
  b.  Set `WORKDIR` environment variable to contain {TechnologyShortName}
      TCK software working directory. This directory will contain raw testing
      data and results.
  c.  Set `jck.env.jaxb.classes.jaxbClasses` property to contain The Checker
      Framework library and all {TechnologyShortName} libraries:
        * /workspace/checker.jar
        * /workspace/mod/jakarta.activation.jar
        * /workspace/mod/jakarta.xml.bind-api.jar
        * /workspace/mod/jaxb-core.jar
        * /workspace/mod/jaxb-impl.jar
        * /workspace/mod/jaxb-jxc.jar
  d.  Set `jck.env.jaxb.testExecute.cmdAsFile` property to contain Java SE 8
      installation Directory.
  e.  Set `jck.env.jaxb.testExecute.otherEnvVars` property to contain
        * JAVA_HOME variable with Java SE 8 installation directory,
        * JAXB_HOME variable with {TechnologyShortName} installation directory,
        * JAXB_ENDORSED variable with {TechnologyShortName} API jar file.
  f.  Set `jck.env.jaxb.schemagen.run.jxcCmd` property to contain proper schema
      generator script for your platform.
  g.  Set `jck.env.jaxb.xsd_compiler.testCompile.xjcCmd` property to contain
      proper schema compiler script for your platform.
  h.  Set `jck.env.jaxb.xsd_compiler.skipValidationOptional` property to contain
      value `Yes`. XML validation is implemented from JAXP
      in {TechnologyShortName} {TechnologyVersion} Compatible Implementation.

4.1.2 {TechnologyShortName}-Specific Configuration Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A number of properties in the JavaTest harness configuration file
are generic and apply to most Java product TCK suites. This section
describes configuration settings that are specific to the
{TechnologyShortName} TCK.

The {TechnologyShortName} TCK {TechnologyVersion} includes a special
configuration properties used by the JavaTest harness to collect
information from you about your test environment and to create the
configuration used to run tests. The TCK configuration properties consists
of the following types:

* *Test Environment*: the first type of the properties collects
information about the test environment used to run the
{TechnologyShortName} TCK {TechnologyVersion} (such as the type of
environment and the type of agent used).
* *Schema Compiler Questions*: the second type of the properties collects
information about how to compile the source schema on your platform.
  ** XML Validation Tests: optional tests that must be run if schema
     validation is performed using a mechanism other than JAXP.
* *Schema Generator Questions*: the type section of the properties collects
information about how to generate XML schema from Java sources on your
platform.
* *How Tests are Run*: the last section of the properties collects
information on how the tests are run (such as Keywords and the Exclude
List).

Configuration Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The table describes the configuration properties and gives examples of relevant
values to correctly configure the JavaTest harness to run the test suite.

[[GCLHUC1]][[GCLHUC2]][[GCLHUC3]]

Table 4-1 Configuration Properties and Relevant Values

[width="100%",cols="15%,45%,40%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property Name |Identifier and Description |Comments and Proposed Values
|Configuration Name |
*Identifier: jck.env.envName*

Provide a short identifier that names the configuration you are creating. |
This is a short string that identifies this particular configuration.
Select a name that describes the configuration.

Example: `jaxb_win32`

The name must begin with a letter, followed by letters, digits, or an
underscore, and must not contain a white space or punctuation
characters.

|Description |
*Identifier: jck.env.description*

Provide a short description that identifies the configuration you are creating. |
JavaTest uses this short description to
provide more detail about the configuration,
for example, in reports. This information
might be useful to an auditor looking at the
test run reports, and could include the
version number of the product and the name
of the tester.

Example: `John Smith x86 Java Architecture for XML Binding 2.3`

|Execution Mode |
*Identifier: jck.env.testPlatform.multiJVM*

Specify whether you want to run the tests in SingleJVM or MultiJVM
mode. Depending on the selected mode, you can configure to run the
compiler either from the command line, or via the Java Compiler API,
or via a custom class accessed by the core reflection API. |
Answer `MultiJVM Mode` if the JavaTest harness can directly start your
product, for example, from a command line in an MSDOS window or UNIX
shell; this is the required mode for the XML Binding TCK.

Typically, applications that do not support such actions run in
point-and-click environments or in browsers. For example, the JavaTest
harness cannot start a new instance of a Java virtual machine inside a
browser.

If you answer MultiJVM Mode , then you need to answer additional
interview questions to specify whether you plan to run the tests
locally. In addition, you need to specify the details about the Java
Virtual Machine in which the tests will run (the questions in the
*Runtime Other JVM* section of this interview) and the details about
the Java launcher.

|Execute Locally |
*Identifier: jck.env.testPlatform.local*

Will you run the TCK tests on the system that hosts the JavaTest harness?

|If you plan to run the tests on the system on which you are running
this interview, then the editor gathers configuration information
directly from the system. For example, you will be able to browse the
local file system to point to the required files.

|Agent Type |
*Identifier: jck.env.jaxb.agent.agentType*

The JavaTest Agent can be run in two modes: active and passive.
Which mode do you wish to use?

|Select the agent type you wish to use. If you want to use the passive
agent, then additional properties must be provided to specify
the passive agent host and default agent port.

|Passive Host |
*Identifier: jck.env.jaxb.agent.agentPassiveHost*

What is the of the host on which you run the tests?

|This is the name of the system on which the passive agent runs and
executes tests. The name of the system must be accessible from the
system on which JavaTest runs.  Since the JavaTest agent is passive,
you can only change the machine you specify here by running this
interview again and changing the name of the passive host.

|Default Agent Port |
*Identifier: jck.env.jaxb.agent.useAgentPortDefault*

Do you wish to use the default port for the JavaTest harness to contact
the JavaTest Agent?

|By default, the JavaTest harness communicates with a passive agent
using port 1908. You must change only the default if you are running
more than one passive agent on a system; this might be the case if you
have set up batch runs.

If you answer `No`, then you will need to specify the default port
number in the next interview question.

|Passive Port |
*Identifier: jck.env.jaxb.agent.agentPassivePort*

Which port does the JavaTest harness use to contact the JavaTest Agent?

|Specify the port you want to use to communicate with the JavaTest agent.

|Test Platform File Separator |
*Identifier: jck.env.jaxb.agent.fileSeparator*

Which file separator character is used on the test platform?

|Specify the appropriate file separator for your operating system.

For example, for Windows, use the back slash `\` character. For Solaris
OS or Linux operation system, use the forward slash `/` character.

|Test Platform Path Separator |
*Identifier: jck.env.jaxb.agent.pathSeparator*

Which path separator character is used on the test platform?.

|Specify the appropriate path separator for your operating system.

For example, on Windows systems, specify the `;` character, on Unix
systems specify the `:` character. Other platforms may differ.

|Agent Map File |
*Identifier: jck.env.jaxb.agent.mapArgs*

|Because JavaTest and the JavaTest agent run on different systems,
values such as path names and variable names may differ on each system.
For example, if a file is accessed over a network, it might be mounted
as `H:\tests\lib` on the JavaTest system and as `F:\tests\lib` on the
system running the JavaTest agent.  The map file is used to associate
values used on the JavaTest agent with those used by JavaTest. The map
file is specified on the JavaTest agent, but the use of the map must be
enabled here. For more information about map files, refer to the
JavaTest User's Guide or to the JavaTest online help.

|Java Launcher |
*Identifier: jck.env.jaxb.testExecute.cmdAsFile*

Enter the full path name of the Java launcher that runs the tests through
the Java Compiler API interface.

|This property is required only if `jck.env.testPlatform.multiJVM` property
value has been set to `Yes`.

This is the command used on the reference system to invoke the `java` command.

NOTE: Use the `java` command in JDK (not JRE).

On Solaris or Linux platforms, use expanded value of: `$JAVA_HOME/bin/java`

  * For example: `/usr/java/bin/java`

On Win32 systems, use expanded value of: `%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java.exe`

  * For example: `C:\Java\jdk–9\bin\java.exe`

Ensure that you supply the full file name, including the file extension.

|Other Options |
*Identifier: jck.env.jaxb.testExecute.otherOpts*

Specify any additional commandline options that must be set.

|Specify any command-line options that JavaTest should set for your
compiler when it runs the tests on your system. Specify the options
using `name=value` pairs. For example you may want to specify:
`-Xmx256m -Xms128m` to change the default maximum and initial Java heap
size.

|Other Environment Variables |
*Identifier: jck.env.jaxb.testExecute.otherEnvVars*

Except for CLASSPATH, if there are any other environment variables
that must be set for the reference Java launcher, enter them here.

|Specify any environment variables that the JavaTest harness should use
in the environment created to run the tests on your system. Specify the
variables using the `name=value` pairs.

You must specify at least `JAVA_HOME` and `JAXB_HOME`.

The JavaTest cannot inherit environment variables from your operating
system environment. If you find that your tests run correctly outside
of the JavaTest harness, but do not run correctly using the JavaTest
harness, then the reason might be that a value set in your operating
system environment is not available to the test. If you check your
operating system environment and determine that this is the case, then
set the missing values here.

|Need Extra XML Binding Classes |
*Identifier: jck.env.jaxb.classes.needJaxbClasses*

Do you need to specify extra XML Binding classes for the Java launcher to
execute tests?

|The XML Binding classes must be available (that is, can be found and loaded)
during test execution. This means that {TechnologyShortName} JAR
archives which contain the {TechnologyShortName} classes
must be on the class path of the the Java VM executing the test.

Answer `No` if the {TechnologyShortName} JAR archives are in the Java
default class path, for example, all jar files are stored in the
jdk_install_dir/jre/lib/ext directory.

Answer `Yes` if some directories or archives are not located on the
Java VM default class path.

If you answer `Yes`, then must specify necessary {TechnologyShortName} archives.

|Extra XML Binding Classes |
*Identifier: jck.env.jaxb.classes.jaxbClasses*

Extra XML Binding classes to be put on class path of the the Java VM executing
the test. |

Specify all necessary {TechnologyShortName} archives required for tests
execution. Archive files must be specified with full path and separated
by space.

|Schema Compiler Operation Mode |
*Identifier: jck.env.jaxb.xsd_compiler.defaultOperationMode*

Would you like to run your schema compiler in default operation mode?

|A {TechnologyShortName} compatible implementation must
support a default operating mode in which
all the required XML Schema to Java
bindings that are described in the XML Binding
specification must be implemented. Errors
must be reported when alternative or
extension non-required features are
encountered.

A {TechnologyShortName} compatible implementation may
support non-default operating modes. These
modes must support all the XML Schema to
Java bindings that are described in XML Binding
specification, but may also generate
alternative or extension bindings for XML
Schema constructs, which are not required
by this specification.

If you select `Yes`, then the schema compiler
is supposed to run in default operation
mode and the tests for non-required
features must be passed (as negative tests
with expected error messages).

If you select `No`, then the schema compiler
is supposed to run in non-default operation
mode and the tests for non-required
features will not be run. For more
information on default operation mode
requirements, see the Compatibility section
of the {TechnologyShortName} specification.

|Optional XML Validation Tests |
*Identifier: jck.env.jaxb.xsd_compiler.skipValidationOptional*

Is Schema Validation implemented via mechanism different from JAXP?

|XML validation can be implemented from
JAXP or from some other mechanism. If the
validation is implemented from JAXP, then
validation checking tests can be skipped by
deselecting them in the test interview. If you
use some other tools for schema validation,
then XML validation tests are mandatory.

|Schema Compiler Run Command |
*Identifier: jck.env.jaxb.xsd_compiler.testCompile. xjcCmd*

Enter the command to run the a schema compiler.

|This is the command used to invoke your
schema compiler. For example, for the
Eclipse XML Binding implementation on Linux we
provide a script `$TS_HOME/linux/bin/xjc.sh`,
which compiles schemas into class files.
The command is as follows:

`/bin/sh /workspace/JAXB-TCK-3.0/linux/bin/xjc.sh`

For the Eclipse XML Binding implementation on
Windows, we provide a script `%TS_HOME%\win32\bin\xjc.bat`,
which compiles schemas into class files.
The command is as follows:

`c:\workspace\JAXB-TCK-3.0\win32\bin\xjc.bat`

The xjc script supports the following
mandatory command-line options:
`xjc -p <pkg> -d <dir> <schema files>`
where:

  • `-p <pkg>` specifies the target package
  • `-d <dir>` specifies the directory to

store generated files.

|Schema Compiler Class |
*Identifier: jaxb.xsd_compiler.run.compilerWrapperClass*

You must provide a custom class to invoke your compiler. This class
should implement the `com.sun.jaxb_tck.lib.SchemaCompilerTool` interface.

|When you run schema compilation through
the JavaTest agent, your schema compiler
will be executed in the agent's JVM. Your
implementation must provide a custom class
to invoke your schema compilation tool. This
class should implement the
`SchemaCompilerTool` interface:

`package com.sun.jaxb_tck.lib;
public interface SchemaCompilerTool {
/**
* @param xsdFiles – array of strings
containing schema files
* @param packageName – the target
package
* @param outDir – output directory
where java file(s) will be generated
* @param out - output stream for
logging
* @param err - error stream for logging
* @return 0 if java file(s) generated
successfully
*/
int compile(String[] xsdFiles, String
packageName, File outDir, PrintStream
out, PrintStream err);
}`

Schema compilation should be
accomplished during invocation of compile
method.
The XML Binding TCK includes the following class
that is fully compatible with Eclipse's
compatible implementation and that can be
used for schema compilation:
`com.sun.jaxb_tck.lib.SchemaCompiler.`
The realization of the
method `compile(String[] xsdFiles,
String packageName, File outDir,
PrintStream out, PrintStream err)`
compiles a schema into `java` sources.
If your implementation doesn't provide such
a class, then create it and specify it here.

|Schema Generator Presence |
*Identifier: jck.env.jaxb.schemagen.skipJ2XOptional*

Does your implementation provide schema generator which is able to
generate schemas from Java sources?

|Java Architecture for XML Binding 2.3
specification does not require any
implementation, which provides a possibility
to generate the schemas from the java
sources. If they are provided, then all
specification requirements should be met.

|Schema Generator Run Command |
*Identifier: jck.env.jaxb.schemagen.run.jxcCmd*

Enter the command to run the schema generator.

|This is the command used to invoke your
schema generator. For example, for the
Eclipse XML Binding implementation on Linux we
provide a script `$TS_HOME/linux/bin/schemagen.sh`, which
generates the schemas from the java files.
The command is as follows:

`/bin/sh /workspace/JAXB-TCK-3.0/linux/bin/schemagen.sh`

For the Eclipse {TechnologyShortName} implementation on
Windows, we provide a script `%TS_HOME%\win32\bin\schemagen.bat`,
which compiles the schemas into class files.
The command is as follows:

`c:\workspace\JAXB-TCK-3.0\win32\bin\schemagen.bat`

The schemagen script supports the following
mandatory command-line options:
`schemagen -d <dir> <java files>`, where
`-d <dir>` specifies the directory to store the
generated files.

|Schema Generator Class |
*Identifier: jck.env.jaxb.schemagen.run.schemagenWrapperClass*

You must provide a custom class to invoke your schema generator. This
class should implement the com.sun.jaxb_tck.lib.SchemaGenTool interface.

|When you run schema generation through
JavaTest agent, your schema generator will
be executed in the agent's JVM. Your
implementation must provide a custom class
to invoke your schema generation tool. This
class should implement the SchemaGenTool
interface:

`package com.sun.jaxb_tck.lib;
public interface SchemaGenTool {
/**
* @param javaFiles - array of strings
containing java files
* @param outDir - output directory
where schema file(s) will be generated
* @param out – output stream for
logging
* @param err – error stream for logging
* @return 0 if schema file(s)
generated successfully
*/
int generate(String[] javaFiles, File
outDir, PrintStream out, PrintStream
err);
}`

Schema generations should be complete
during the invocation of the generate
method.
The XML Binding TCK includes the following class
that is fully compatible with Eclipse's
compatible implementation and that can be
used for schema generation:
`com.sun.jaxb_tck.lib.SchemaGen`. The
realization of the method
`generate(String[] javaFiles, File
outDir, PrintStream out, PrintStream
err)` generates the XML schemas from the
`java` files.
If your implementation doesn't provide such
a class, then create it and specify it here.

|Specify an Exclude List? |
*Identifier: jck.excludeList.needExcludeList*

Do you wish to specify an exclude list?

|Answer `Yes` if you want to specify an
exclude list for the test run. If you select
Yes, then select the location of the exclude
list to use.

Answer `No` if you want to run all tests that
are not filtered out by other run filters.

|Which Exclude List? |
*Identifier: jck.excludeList.excludeListType*

Which exclude list do you wish to
use?

|This question appears only if you answered
Yes to the previous configuration interview
question.

Select either the Initial option to use the
exclude list provided with the test suite or
the Specify option to specify the exclude list
you wish to use.

|Specify Exclude List Files |
*Identifier: jck.excludeList.customFiles*

Specify the files that make up the
exclude list you wish to use.

|Click *Add* to activate a file chooser with
which you select an exclude list file. Exclude
list files conventionally use the
extension ``.jtx`.

|Specify Keywords? |
*Identifier: jck.keywords.needKeywords*

Do you wish to specify a keyword
expression to select/reject tests
based on keywords contained in
each test description?

|Keywords are tokens associated with
specific tests.

Answer `Yes` to run tests based on the
keyword and the other run filter settings. If
you select Yes, then you are asked to
specify the keyword to use.

Answer `No` to run all tests that are not
filtered out by other run filters.

|Specify Status? |
*Identifier: jck.priorStatus.needStatus*

Do you wish to select tests to run
based on their result in a previous
run?

|Answer Yes to run tests based on the
status from the previous test run and the
other run filter settings. If you select Yes,
then you are asked for the status or
statuses.

Answer No to run all tests that are not
filtered out by other run filters.

|Concurrency |
*Identifier:
jck.concurrency.concurrency*

The JavaTest harness can run tests
concurrently. Specify the maximum
number of tests that should be run
concurrently:

|The JavaTest harness can run tests
concurrently. If you are running the tests on
a multiprocessor computer, then the
concurrency can accelerate your test runs.
The default range of values that the
JavaTest harness uses is from 1 to 50.
For the first test run, keep this value set to
1.
|Time Factor |
*Identifier: jck.timeout.timeout*

Specify a time factor that is applied
to each test's default timeout. For
example, specifying 2 doubles the
time for each test (the default is 1):

|The default 1.0 corresponds to 10 minutes.
Use the floating point format specific to your
locale.

NOTE: Setting a proper time factor value requires
consideration of such technical factors as the
network connector speed.
