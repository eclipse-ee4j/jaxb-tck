5 Executing Tests
-----------------

The {TechnologyShortName} TCK uses the JavaTest harness to execute the
tests in the test suite. For detailed instructions that explain how to
run and use JavaTest, see the JavaTest User's Guide and Reference in
the documentation bundle.

This chapter includes the following topics:

* link:#GBFUZ[Starting JavaTest]
* link:#GBFWM[Running a Subset of the Tests]
* link:#GCLRR[Running the TCK Against your selected CI]
* link:#GCLRZ[Running the TCK Against a Vendor's Implementation]
* link:#GBFVK[Test Reports]


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The instructions in this chapter assume that you have installed and
configured your test environment as described in
link:install.html#GBFTP[Chapter 3, "Installation,"] and
link:config.html#GBFVV[Chapter 4, "Setup and Configuration,"],
respectively.

=======================================================================

ifdef::rebuild[]
As explained in link:rebuild.html#GCLIZ[Appendix B, "Packaging the
Test Applications in Servlet-Compliant WAR
Files With VI-Specific Information,"] the {TechnologyShortName} TCK
introduces the concept of repackaging the TCK tests.

[[GBFUZ]][[starting-javatest]]

5.1 Starting JavaTest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

General way to run the {TechnologyShortName} TCK using the JavaTest harness
software is from the command line in your shell environment

[[GBFWH]][[to-start-javatest-in-gui-mode]]

5.1.1 To Start JavaTest in Command-Line Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

include::using-examples.inc[]

[[GBFWM]][[running-a-subset-of-the-tests]]

5.2 Running a Subset of the Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following modes to run a subset of the tests:

* link:#GBFWK[Section 5.2.1, "To Run a Subset of Tests in Command-Line Mode"]
* link:#GBFVL[Section 5.2.2, "To Run a Subset of Tests in Batch Mode
Based on Prior Result Status"]

[[GBFWK]][[to-run-a-subset-of-tests-in-command-line-mode]]

5.2.1 To Run a Subset of Tests in Command-Line Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Change to the directory containing the tests you want to run.
2.  Start the test run by executing the following command: +
+
[source]
----
ant runclient
----
+
The tests in the directory and its subdirectories are run.

[[GBFVL]][[to-run-a-subset-of-tests-in-batch-mode-based-on-prior-result-status]]

5.2.2 To Run a Subset of Tests in Batch Mode Based on Prior Result Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can run certain tests in batch mode based on the test's prior run
status by specifying the `priorStatus` system property when invoking
`ant`

Invoke `ant` with the `priorStatus` property.

The accepted values for the `priorStatus` property are any combination
of the following:

* `fail`
* `pass`
* `error`
* `notRun`

For example, you could run all the {TechnologyShortName} tests with a
status of failed and error by invoking the following commands:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant -DpriorStatus="fail,error" runclient
----

Note that multiple `priorStatus` values must be separated by commas.

[[GCLRR]][[running-the-tck-against-the-ri]]

5.3 Running the TCK Against another CI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some test scenarios are designed to ensure that the configuration and deployment of
all the prebuilt {TechnologyShortName} TCK tests against one Compatible
Implementation are successful operating with other compatible implementations, and that the TCK is ready for
compatibility testing against the Vendor and Compatible Implementations.

1.  Verify that you have followed the configuration instructions in
link:config.html#GBFVU[Section 4.1, "Configuring Your Environment to Run
the TCK Against the Compatible Implementation."]
2.  Run the tests, as described in link:#GBFUZ[Section 5.1, "Starting
JavaTest,"] and, if desired, link:#GBFWM[Section 5.2, "Running a Subset
of the Tests."]

[[GCLRZ]][[running-the-tck-against-a-vendors-implementation]]

5.4 Running the TCK Against a Vendor's Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This test scenario is one of the compatibility test phases that all
Vendors must pass.

1.  Verify that you have followed the configuration instructions in
link:config.html#GCLHU[Section 4.2, "Configuring Your Environment to
Repackage and Run the TCK Against the Vendor Implementation."]
2.  Run the tests, as described in link:#GBFUZ[Section 5.1, "Starting
JavaTest,"] and, if desired, link:#GBFWM[Section 5.2, "Running a Subset
of the Tests."]

[[GBFVK]][[test-reports]]

5.5 Test Reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A set of report files is created for every test run. These report files
can be found in the report directory you specify. After a test run is
completed, the JavaTest harness writes HTML reports for the test run.
You can view these files in the JavaTest ReportBrowser when running in
GUI mode, or in the web browser of your choice outside the JavaTest
interface.

To see all of the HTML report files, enter the URL of the `report.html`
file. This file is the root file that links to all of the other HTML
reports.

The JavaTest harness also creates a `summary.txt` file in the report
directory that you can open in any text editor. The `summary.txt` file
contains a list of all tests that were run, their test results, and
their status messages.

[[GBFWD]][[creating-test-reports]]

5.5.1 Creating Test Reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To generate test reports, enter the following command:

[source]
----
${JAVA_HOME}/bin/java -jar javatest.jar \
  -workdir ${TS_HOME}/work -writereport ${TS_HOME}/report
----

Choose proper directories for {TechnologyShortName} TCK tests working directory
and report directory.

5.5.2 Viewing an Existing Test Report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the Web browser of your choice to view the `index.html`
file in the report directory you specified from the command line.
